## Features
- **Comprehensive Multi-language Support**
    + The Glot API provides 40 common programming languages to meet various coding needs.
- **Convenient Projects Saving and Execution**
    + Save project URLs locally via commands; next time, simply enter the project name for instant running.
- **Support for Multiple Output Formats**
    + Convert Markdown/HTML to images, support custom Base64 formats (images, audio, video), text-to-speech, download images from links, and convert LaTeX to images. Also supports outputting message chains, multiple messages, or forwarded messages — meeting the needs for generating various effects.
- **Intelligent Data Storage and Retrieval**
    + Customize data persistence so that subsequent runs can directly read stored data, allowing program logic to continue seamlessly. Also, able to retrieve information such as nickname, QQ number, and group chat details.
- **Proactive Group and Private Messages**
    + The program can proactively send messages to specified group chats or individuals, enabling real-time alerts and instant interaction.
- **Local Code High-speed Caching**
    + Automatically cache code on the first execution; subsequent runs do not require re-downloading, greatly improving load speed.
